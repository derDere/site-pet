# Site Pet

![Title](title.png)

site-pet is a lightweight JavaScript script that allows you to add a small animated pet to any website. This pet will roam around the webpage, adding a touch of fun and interactivity for your visitors.

## Demo

Check out the [demo page](https://derdere.github.io/site-pet/) to see site-pet in action!

## Features

- **Roaming**: The pet will walk around the webpage, exploring its surroundings.
- **Sleeping**: Occasionally, the pet will take a nap in a cozy corner of the page.
- **Interactivity**: When the pet is idle, you can interact with it by patting it.

## Usage

To add site-pet to your own website, simply include the following JavaScript code block in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://derdere.github.io/site-pet/site-pet.js"></script>
<script>
  // replace example with the desired sprite name
  var ele = createSitePet('example');
</script>
```
